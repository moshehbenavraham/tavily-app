# PRD Phase 00: Core Setup

**Status**: Not Started
**Sessions**: 6 (initial estimate)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

**Progress**: 0/6 sessions (0%)

---

## Overview

Phase 00 establishes the complete backend integration for the Tavily API. This includes adding the tavily-python SDK dependency, creating a robust service layer with async support, implementing comprehensive Pydantic schemas for all operations (search, extract, crawl, map), building RESTful API endpoints, and ensuring proper error handling and test coverage.

## Upcoming Sessions

- Session 01: Dependency and Configuration

---

## Objectives

1. Add Tavily SDK dependency and configure environment settings
2. Create service layer with TavilyService class managing sync/async clients
3. Implement comprehensive Pydantic schemas for all Tavily operations
4. Create API routes for search, extract, crawl, and map endpoints
5. Implement robust error handling with proper HTTP status codes
6. Write unit and integration tests with high coverage

---

## Prerequisites

- FastAPI full-stack boilerplate is functional
- Python environment configured with Poetry or pip
- Valid Tavily API key available for testing
- Existing authentication system operational

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- TavilyService as singleton with dependency injection
- Async-first approach with sync fallback
- Request/Response Pydantic models for each operation
- Custom exception hierarchy for Tavily errors

### Technologies
- tavily-python >= 0.5.0
- Pydantic v2 for schema validation
- FastAPI dependency injection
- pytest + pytest-asyncio for testing
- httpx for async HTTP in tests

### Risks
- **SDK Version Compatibility**: Mitigation - pin exact version, test thoroughly
- **API Key Exposure in Tests**: Mitigation - use environment variables, never commit
- **Rate Limiting During Tests**: Mitigation - mock external calls in unit tests

---

## Success Criteria

Phase complete when:
- [ ] All 6 sessions completed
- [ ] All four Tavily endpoints (search, extract, crawl, map) functional
- [ ] Endpoints require valid JWT authentication
- [ ] All Tavily SDK parameters exposed via request schemas
- [ ] Error responses include proper status codes and structured bodies
- [ ] Unit tests pass with mocked responses
- [ ] Integration tests pass with valid API key
- [ ] No lint errors or type check failures

## Dependencies

### Depends On
- Existing FastAPI boilerplate structure
- Existing authentication system

### Enables
- Phase 01: Frontend Integration

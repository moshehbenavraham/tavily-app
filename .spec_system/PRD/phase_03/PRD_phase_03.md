# PRD Phase 03: Deep Research Backend

**Status**: In Progress
**Sessions**: 6 (initial estimate)
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

**Progress**: 3/6 sessions (50%)

---

## Overview

Phase 03 implements the backend infrastructure for two deep research APIs: Perplexity Sonar Deep Research (synchronous) and Google Gemini Deep Research (asynchronous with polling). This phase establishes configuration settings, Pydantic schemas, custom exceptions, service classes, and FastAPI routes for both APIs following the existing project patterns from Phases 00-02.

## Completed Sessions

### Session 01: Configuration and Environment (2025-12-27)
- Created PerplexitySettings and GeminiSettings configuration classes
- Added 4 StrEnum classes for API options (models, modes, agents)
- Created http_utils.py with reusable timeout and header utilities
- Updated .env.example with all PERPLEXITY_* and GEMINI_* variables

### Session 02: Perplexity Schemas and Exceptions (2025-12-27)
- Created 4 enums: PerplexitySearchMode, PerplexityReasoningEffort, PerplexitySearchContextSize, PerplexityRecencyFilter
- Implemented PerplexityDeepResearchRequest schema with 19 parameters and validators
- Created response schemas: PerplexitySearchResult, PerplexityVideo, PerplexityUsage, PerplexityChoice, PerplexityMessage
- Implemented PerplexityAPIError exception with 6 factory methods and PerplexityErrorCode enum
- Updated schemas and exceptions __init__.py with proper exports

### Session 03: Gemini Schemas and Exceptions (2025-12-27)
- Created 3 enums: GeminiInteractionStatus, GeminiStreamEventType, GeminiDeltaType
- Implemented GeminiDeepResearchRequest and GeminiDeepResearchPollRequest schemas for async polling workflow
- Created response schemas: GeminiUsage, GeminiOutput, GeminiDeepResearchJobResponse, GeminiDeepResearchResultResponse
- Implemented GeminiAPIError exception with 9 factory methods and GeminiErrorCode enum
- Updated schemas and exceptions __init__.py with proper exports

## Upcoming Sessions

- Session 04: Perplexity Service and Route

---

## Objectives

1. Add configuration settings for Perplexity and Gemini APIs with environment variable support
2. Create comprehensive Pydantic schemas for all request/response types with proper validation
3. Implement custom exception classes with factory methods for consistent error handling
4. Build service classes for both APIs supporting sync (Perplexity) and async (Gemini) patterns
5. Create FastAPI routes with proper authentication and structured error responses
6. Add exception handlers to the main application for consistent API error responses

---

## Prerequisites

- Phase 02 completed (Saving Results to Items)
- Valid Perplexity API key for testing
- Valid Gemini API key for testing
- Understanding of existing backend patterns (TavilyService, deps.py, error handling)

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Follow existing service layer pattern established in Phase 00 (TavilyService)
- Use httpx async client for both Perplexity and Gemini API calls
- Implement dependency injection via deps.py for service instantiation
- Maintain consistency with existing ErrorResponse schema for exception handlers

### Technologies
- httpx - async HTTP client for API calls
- Pydantic v2 - request/response validation with StrEnum
- FastAPI - route definitions with proper type hints
- Python 3.11+ - async/await patterns

### API Patterns
- **Perplexity**: Synchronous POST to `/chat/completions` with Bearer auth
- **Gemini**: Asynchronous background job with polling via `/interactions` endpoint

### Risks
- **Perplexity Latency**: Deep research can take 30-60s; 300s timeout configured
- **Gemini Long Running**: Research jobs can run up to 60 minutes; proper polling required
- **Rate Limiting**: Both APIs have rate limits; proper 429 handling essential
- **Schema Complexity**: Many optional fields; careful validation required

- [ ] PerplexityService executes synchronous deep research
- [ ] GeminiService supports start, poll, wait, and cancel operations
- [ ] All endpoints require JWT authentication
- [ ] Exception handlers return structured ErrorResponse
- [ ] No lint errors or type check failures

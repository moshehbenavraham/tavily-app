# PRD Phase 01: Frontend Integration

**Status**: In Progress
**Sessions**: 6
**Estimated Duration**: 12-24 hours

**Progress**: 1/6 sessions (17%)

---

## Overview

Phase 01 delivers the complete frontend integration for Tavily API features. This includes regenerating the OpenAPI client to include Tavily types, creating dedicated page routes for each Tavily operation (search, extract, crawl, map), building reusable form and result display components, integrating with the existing navigation sidebar, and implementing proper loading states, error handling, and responsive design.

The frontend follows the existing boilerplate patterns: TanStack Router for routing, TanStack Query for data fetching, React Hook Form with Zod for form validation, and shadcn/ui components for the UI layer.

## Completed Sessions

### Session 01: API Client and Navigation
- **Completed**: 2025-12-21
- **Tasks**: 22/22
- **Deliverables**: Regenerated OpenAPI client with Tavily types, 4 route placeholders, sidebar navigation

---

## Upcoming Sessions

- Session 02: Search Form and Query

---

## Objectives

1. Regenerate OpenAPI client to include all Tavily request/response types
2. Create Tavily page routes integrated with TanStack Router
3. Build form components with React Hook Form and Zod validation
4. Implement results display components (cards, tables, detail views)
5. Add Tavily navigation items to the existing sidebar
6. Handle loading states, errors, and edge cases with proper UX

---

## Prerequisites

- Phase 00 completed (backend Tavily API fully functional)
- Frontend development environment configured (Node.js, npm)
- Backend server running for OpenAPI spec generation
- Understanding of existing boilerplate patterns

---

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- File-based routing with TanStack Router (`/search`, `/extract`, `/crawl`, `/map`)
- TanStack Query mutations for POST operations
- Shared Tavily components in `components/Tavily/` directory
- Zod schemas mirroring backend Pydantic models

### Technologies
- React 19 with TypeScript
- TanStack Router v1 (file-based routing)
- TanStack Query v5 (data fetching)
- React Hook Form v7 + Zod (form handling)
- shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Sonner for toast notifications
- Lucide React for icons

### Risks
- **OpenAPI Client Drift**: Mitigation - regenerate client whenever backend schemas change
- **Large Crawl Results**: Mitigation - implement virtualization or pagination for large result sets
- **API Timeout UX**: Mitigation - show progress indicators for long-running operations (crawl/map)
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Mitigation - test on multiple screen sizes, use responsive Tailwind classes

## Success Criteria

Phase complete when:
- [ ] All 6 sessions completed
- [x] All Tavily features accessible via navigation sidebar
- [ ] Search form validates input and displays results correctly
- [ ] Extract, crawl, and map pages are fully functional
- [ ] Loading states shown during API calls (skeletons/spinners)
- [ ] Errors displayed via toast notifications
- [ ] UI is responsive on desktop and mobile
- [ ] All new components follow existing code patterns
- [x] No TypeScript errors or lint warnings

## Dependencies

### Depends On
- Phase 00: Core Setup (backend API)

### Enables
- Future phases: Search history, advanced features, caching
